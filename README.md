# PluraSlides

A template for managing multiple [slidev](https://sli.dev) presentation projects in one repository.

Projects are stored by directories in `/slides`. Each project can have its own assets (like `public` and `components` directory).

Build all the slides with:

```sh
npm run build
```

run a single project in watch mode:

```sh
npm run start -- slides/presentation-1/slides.md
```
